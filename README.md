# PK Shop App

A simple multi-page React application using React Router to direct routes and React Parallax for the scroll effect.

These technologies have enabled me to recreate a website I had previously designed on Squarespace for a hot sauce company I had helped create in 2018. At the company I was responsible for the majority of the creative elements, including design and production of the packaging, marketing material and website. The company is no longer selling hot sauce and the original website is no longer live, but thankfully this new application can now live for free on GitHub as a personal tribute.
